## ✨ What is ZUMBRA?

ZUMBRA is a custom programming language built with its own parser, compiler, and virtual machine. It supports function definitions, scoped variables, custom operators, and more — all with a easy syntax and a playful soul.

   ```

### **Linux** 🐧

1. Download the `zumbra-linux` file for Linux from the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/JoseLucasapp/Zumbra-lang/releases).
